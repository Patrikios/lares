}
\arguments{
\item{tiles}{Character. The letters you wish to consider.}

\item{free}{Integer. How many free blank tiles you have?}

\item{force_start, force_end}{Character. Force words to start or end with
a pattern of letters and position. Examples: "S" or "SO" or "__S_O"...
If the string contains tiles that were not specified in \code{tiles}, they
will automatically be included.}

\item{force_str}{Character vector. Force words to contain strings.
If the string contains tiles that were not specified in \code{tiles}, they
will automatically be included.}

\item{force_n, force_max}{Integer. Force words to be n or max n characters 
long. Leave 0 to ignore parameter.}

\item{scores, language}{Character. Any of "en","es","de","fr". 
If scores is not any of those languages, must be a data.frame that 
contains two columns: "tiles" with every letter of the alphabet and 
"scores" for each letter's score. If you wish
to overwrite or complement this dictionaries other words you can set to
\code{"none"} and/or use the \code{words} parameter.
You might also want to set this parameter globally with
\code{Sys.setenv("LARES_LANG" = "en")} and forget about it!}

\item{words}{Character vector. Use if you wish to manually add words.}

\item{quiet}{Boolean. Do not print words as they are being searched.}
